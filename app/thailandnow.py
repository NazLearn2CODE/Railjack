"""Thailand NOW — monthly content-pipeline module (WRITERS + EVENTS).

Two halves share one desk-driven create/attach engine:
  WRITERS — bulk-create blank Google Docs + Trello cards per writer (Paul/Teerin).
  EVENTS  — scout upcoming Thailand events, generate a publicity bundle, then
            spin up a prefilled Doc + card (TIAN desk).

Desks (Paul/Teerin/TIAN) are config rows in configs/tawhan.yaml → options.desks,
so adding/changing a writer is a YAML edit, not code. REST-only via httpx — no
google-api-python-client, no py-trello. See docs/thailandnow-plan.md.
